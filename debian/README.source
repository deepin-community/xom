xom for Debian
==============

The upstream supplied source package contains binary jar files and
classes. Currently no clean source distribution exists. Therefore, the
upstream sources were modified to comply with the Debian Free Software
Guidelines.

Use the rules/get-orig-source target to create the orig.tar.gz.
For more details on repackaging of upstream sources please see the
debian/orig-tar.sh file.
